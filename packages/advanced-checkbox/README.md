# `@jensen95/advanced-checkbox`

A [checkbox](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/master/packages/checkbox) alternative that allows for searching and filtering of options.

Besides the searching it also behaves differently in that it can't be navigated with VIM bindings and `return` picks the selected item if nothing is selected instead submitting nothing.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jensen95/advanced-checkbox
```
